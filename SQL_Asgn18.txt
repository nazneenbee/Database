Assignment – 18

1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum
fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
table, so that each customer’s order will be entered into this table along with his
or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.
CREATE TABLE cityorders
SELECT onum, amt, snum, cunu, city FROM orders NATURAL JOIN customers;

ALTER TABLE cityorders ADD CONSTRAINT onum_fk
FOREIGN key(onum) REFERENCES orders(onum);

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will identify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current
customer.

ALTER TABLE copy_orders ADD
FOREIGN key(prev) REFERENCES copy_orders(onum);
